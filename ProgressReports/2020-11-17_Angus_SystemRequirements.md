# Progress report

Join a room (pairs works best)
The objective is to think about requirements, in more detail.
You need a complete list of User and System requirements for CW2. This exercise will give you a view point from a non-team member. 

(You may want to consider methods to obtain the requirements. )

	1) Person 1, pretend you have taken your group project (e.g. T1) to a software developer (Person 2) and want them to develop it for you. 
	2) The developer (person2) will attempt to elicit User / System requirements. Listen to Person 1 and ask them questions. Write down User Requirements based on what you hear.  (Order them in priority)
	3) If you have clear user requirements , then progress to creating System requirements. (Don’t worry if you don’t get here)
	4) Person2 replays the requirements back to Person1 in order. (Write them down)
Person1, take note of the requirements that person 2 comes up with and add it as a progress report to your group repo.
